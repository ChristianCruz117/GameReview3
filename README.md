## Final Thoughts
This game was so much fun you can go around the city in the bat mobile and lunch out of it and then glide in midair and look for enemies to
fight or silently take them out with ought them knowing you were even there. Batman has so many gadgets to use at his disposal is crazy he
can use batarangs to lure enemies to him, so he can take them down silently. He also has a plastic gel that he can put on walls that are
easily breakable to knock them out with the small explosion. Another gadget he has is a frost grenade to freeze them in place and take them
out. Another thing he can do is take down enemies in ledges of buildings and corners and through walls too. My favorite silent take down 
is the upside down take down, when he hangs upside down and grabs an enemy and knocks them out cold. He can do so many things to take a guy
out is crazy its oe of the best and fun stealth game I’ve played.
