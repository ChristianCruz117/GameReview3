## Details
Game Title: Batman Arkham Knight

## Summary
This game is about the world’s best detective and billionaire Playboy philanthropist Bruce Wayne aka Batman. In this game the main bad guy 
is Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight and they lunch an attack on Gotham City. Also, Scarecrow and the Knight gather all the major super 
villains to hunt down and kill the bat while the city goes into chaos and the only man who can stop all of them is Batman. As you track 
down every super villain to put them behind bars you get to fight and mainly takedown enemies stealthily.

## Final Thoughts
This game was so much fun you can go around the city in the bat mobile and launch out of it and then glide in midair and look for enemies
to fight or silently take them out without them knowing you were even there. Batman has so many gadgets to use at his disposal it is crazy. He can use batarangs to lure enemies to him, so he can take them down silently. He also has a plastic gel that he can put on walls that are
easily breakable to knock them out with the small explosion. Another gadget he has is a frost grenade to freeze them in place and take them
out. Another thing he can do is takedown enemies on ledges of buildings and corners and through walls too. My favorite silent take down 
is the upside down takedown, when he hangs upside down and grabs an enemy and knocks them out cold. He can do so many things to take a guy
out it is crazy. It is one of the best and fun stealth games I’ve played.
